# Heart Dataset Analysis

## Dataset Overview
- Total records: 303
- Features: 14 (including the target variable)
- Target variable: 'AHD' (Presence of heart disease)

## Features
1. Age: Patient's age in years
2. Sex: Patient's sex (1 = male, 0 = female)
3. ChestPain: Type of chest pain (typical, atypical, nonanginal, asymptomatic)
4. RestBP: Resting blood pressure (mm Hg)
5. Chol: Serum cholesterol (mg/dl)
6. Fbs: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true, 0 = false)
7. RestECG: Resting electrocardiographic results
8. MaxHR: Maximum heart rate achieved
9. ExAng: Exercise induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no)
10. Oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11. Slope: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment
12. Ca: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
13. Thal: Thalassemia (normal, fixed defect, reversable defect)
14. AHD: Presence of heart disease (Yes, No) - Target variable

## Data Preprocessing Needed
1. Handle categorical variables:
   - ChestPain: Convert to numerical (e.g., using one-hot encoding)
   - Thal: Convert to numerical
   - AHD: Convert 'Yes' to 1, 'No' to 0
2. Handle missing values (NA in some columns)
3. Normalize numerical features (e.g., using StandardScaler)

## Potential Challenges
1. Class imbalance: Check if 'Yes' and 'No' in AHD are balanced
2. Feature scaling: Features have different scales (e.g., Age vs. Chol)
3. Categorical data: Need to be encoded properly
4. Missing data: Some records have 'NA' values

## Neural Network Considerations
1. Input layer: 13 neurons (or more if using one-hot encoding for categorical variables)
2. Output layer: 1 neuron (binary classification: presence or absence of heart disease)
3. Hidden layers: Can experiment with different architectures
4. Activation functions:
   - Hidden layers: ReLU or tanh
   - Output layer: Sigmoid (for binary classification)
5. Loss function: Binary cross-entropy
6. Optimizer: Adam or RMSprop
7. Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

## Next Steps
1. Implement data preprocessing steps
2. Split data into training and testing sets
3. Scale features
4. Encode categorical variables
5. Handle missing values
6. Adjust neural network architecture based on preprocessed data
7. Train the model
8. Evaluate performance
9. Fine-tune hyperparameters if necessary
